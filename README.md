# Spotify-clone
 It's built entirely with HTML and CSS, with a focus on replicating the visual design and layout. The page features a fixed sidebar for navigation, a dynamic main content area with a grid of albums/playlists, and a persistent player bar at the bottom. The design uses a dark theme with Spotify's signature green accents and is fully responsive.
